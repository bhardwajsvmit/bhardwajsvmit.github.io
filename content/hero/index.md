I’m a software development engineer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences for the web and mobile. Currently, I’m focused on building accessible, human-centered products at [myclassroom](https://myclassroom.digital/).

<!-- Outside work, I occasionally blog on [Medium](https://.medium.com/). -->
